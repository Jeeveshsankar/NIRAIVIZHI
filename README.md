# NIRAIVIZHI – Smart Water Monitoring & Autonomous Cleaning System

NIRAIVIZHI is an integrated smart solution designed to monitor water quality, detect pollution risks, and autonomously clean water surfaces using IoT, robotics, and cloud technologies. The system focuses on improving environmental sustainability and public health, especially in rural and underserved regions.

## Project Overview

Water bodies in many regions suffer from poor monitoring, pollution, and floating waste accumulation. NIRAIVIZHI addresses these challenges by combining an autonomous surface-cleaning robot with a real-time monitoring application that provides actionable insights and alerts.

At the core of the system is HYDROBOT, an autonomous water surface cleaning robot, paired with a smart application for live data visualization and system control.

## Key Objectives

- Real-time monitoring of water quality and system parameters  
- Autonomous removal of floating waste from water surfaces  
- Sustainable operation using solar-powered energy  
- Cloud-based data storage and analytics  
- Scalable design for lakes, ponds, and reservoirs  

## System Architecture

The system is structured into three layers:

**Hardware Layer (HYDROBOT)**  
- ESP32 microcontroller  
- Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection  
- Load cell for waste weight measurement  
- Solar panel and battery monitoring system  

**Application Layer (HYDROSYNC)**  
- Real-time sensor data visualization  
- GPS-based tracking  
- Battery and waste status monitoring  
- Alerts and notifications  
- Historical data analysis  

**Cloud Layer**  
- MongoDB Atlas for secure, real-time data storage  

## Tech Stack

**Hardware:**  
ESP32, Ultrasonic Sensor, HX711 Load Cell, Solar Panel, Battery Voltage Sensor  

**Software:**  
Flutter, Arduino IDE, MongoDB Atlas  

## Features

- Real-time water and system monitoring  
- Autonomous surface waste collection  
- Energy-efficient, solar-powered operation
